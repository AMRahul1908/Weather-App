# Weather App

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

 A responsive web application for displaying real-time weather information 
based on user input. Built using React.js with dynamic components and integrated the 
OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and present current weather data. Implemented clean 
UI design, error handling for invalid inputs, and deployed the application for live 
access.
