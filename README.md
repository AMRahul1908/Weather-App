# Weather App

a responsive web application for exploring and managing vacation rental 
listings. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with user- 
friendly interfaces for browsing, adding, editing, and deleting listings. Implemented 
RESTful APIs for secure CRUD operations and deployed the application on Render for 
live access.
