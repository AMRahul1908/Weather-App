# Weather-App
A responsive web application for displaying real-time weather information  based on user input. Built using React.js with dynamic components and integrated the  OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and present current weather data. Implemented clean  UI design, error handling for invalid inputs, and deployed the application for live  access.
